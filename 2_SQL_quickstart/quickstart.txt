SQL Quick Start

Examples

SELECT * FROM table; 

INSERT INTO table (a,b,c)
VALUES (1,2,3)
ORDER BY b;

UPDATE table SET a=7,b=5;

DELETE FROM table WHERE a=7;

SELECT COUNT (*) FROM table

Example: 
Select all rows from Country table:

SELECT * from Country;

SELECT->rows 
*-> all columns
from->preadtes source
Country->source

May or may not be in order unless specified.

To display in order:

SELECT * from Country ORDER By Name;

Alpahbetical order by name.

Specifying columns:

SELECT Name, LifeExpectancy FROM Country ORDER BY Name; //without label

With specific label
SELECT Name, LifeExpectancy AS 'Life Expectancy' FROM Country ORDER BY Name;
(use AS)

SELECT 1+2;
1+2->column
3->content

(Specifying source is not necessary).

Return Count :

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Country;

//Returns number of rows

Selecting only those rows one is interested in:

SELECT Name, Continent, Region FROM Country; //All rows

SELECT Name, Continent, Region FROM Country WHERE Continent='Europe'; //46 rows

WHERE clause uses it to determine which rows to select

SELECT Name, Continent FROM Country WHERE CONTINENT='Europe' LIMIT 5;

Selecting particular columns

SELECT * FROM Country ORDER BY Code LIMIT 5;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Country; //239

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Country WHERE Population >1000000;

//10

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Country WHERE Population>1000000 AND Continent='Europe'
