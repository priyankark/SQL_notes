Table Relationships
------------------

Imagine tables as venn diagrams. The intersection of the two can help determine conditions for join

Inner, outer joins

Left inner join and Right outer joins

Accessing related tables with Join
----------------------------------

SELECT l.description AS L, r.description AS R FROM left AS l JOIN right AS r ON l.id=r.id;


SELECT c.name AS Cust, i.name AS Item, s.price AS Price FROM customer AS c JOIN sale AS s oN s.customer_id=c.id JOIN item AS i ON s.item_id=i.id
ORDER BY Cust, Item;

DELETE FROM customer WHERE ID=4
